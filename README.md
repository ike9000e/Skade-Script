# Skade-Script
----------------
Welcome to the C++ scripting mini engine that aims to implement a handfull set of features from the ECMA Script specification. A way to freely manipulate objects exported from the C++ using arithmetic, parentheses or assignment operators. Enables compilation independent scripting from external sources an application can take input from, such as: config files, command-line or UI controls.

# For documenataion please see attached archive files, either in root directory or attached to the releases.
Provided are Doxygen generated API docs in two formats, zipped html and CHM.

Source code and documentation will be available as zip archives from now on.
Having to deal with *git* or *svn* tools to publish my work is a beautiful waste of time.
